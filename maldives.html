                <p>
                    <img src="images/maldives-geography.jpg">The Maldives is a nation of islands in the
                    <mark> Indian Ocean</mark>
                    ,
                    that spans across the equator. The country is comprised of 1192 islands that stretch along
                    a length of 871 kilometers. While the country covers an area of approximately 90,000 square
                    kilometers, only 298 square kilometers of that is dry land. The islands are grouped into a
                    double chain of 26 atolls. The country’s unique geography mesmerizes the visitor. Reefs that
                    offer bands of color, tiny jewel-like islands rimmed with the whitest of soft sand surrounded
                    by the clearest shallow waters that one can imagine. Only 200 of the islands are inhabited, and
                    a select few on each of the atolls are resorts and some of the islands are used for industry and
                    agriculture.
                    The beauty of the Maldives is not only above the water. The Maldives is home to about five
                    percent
                    of the planet’s reefs that comes with an explosion of color contributed by soft and hard corals
                    that form them.
                    The reefs are home to a thousand species of fish. Lured by the rich nutrients that flow in with
                    the currents,
                    large pelagic fishes such as manta rays and whale sharks also make the Maldives their home.

            <div class="maldives-explore">

                <p>
                    The Maldives has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) under the Köppen climate classification,
                    which is affected by the large landmass of South Asia to the north.
                    Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world, the temperature
                    is constantly hot and often humid. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating
                    of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over
                    South Asia, resulting in the southwest monsoon. Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry
                    season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season associated with the
                    southwest monsoon which brings strong winds and storms. The shift from the dry northeast monsoon
                    to the moist southwest monsoon occurs during April and May. During this period, the southwest
                    winds
                    contribute to the formation of the southwest monsoon, which reaches Maldives at the beginning of
                    June
                    and lasts until the end of November. However, the weather patterns of Maldives do not always
                    conform
                    to the monsoon patterns of South Asia. The annual rainfall averages 254 centimetres (100 in) in
                    the
                    north and 381 centimetres (150 in) in the south. The monsoonal influence is greater in the north
                    of
                    the Maldives than in the south, more influenced by the equatorial currents. The average high
                    temperature
                    is 31.5 degrees Celsius and the average low temperature is 26.4 degrees Celsius.

                    Historically, the Maldives provided enormous quantities of cowry shells,
                    an international currency of the early ages. From the 2nd century AD, the islands
                    \were known as the 'Money Isles' by the Arabs.[126] Monetaria moneta were used for
                    centuries as a currency in Africa, and huge amounts of Maldivian cowries were introduced
                    into Africa by western nations during the period of slave trade.[127] The cowry is now the
                    symbol of the Maldives Monetary Authority. In the early 1970s, the Maldives was one of the
                    world's 20 poorest countries, with a population of 100,000. The economy at the time was largely
                    dependent on fisheries and trading local goods such as coir rope, ambergris (Maavaharu), and
                    coco de mer (Tavakkaashi) with neighbouring countries and East Asian countries. The Maldivian
                    government began a largely successful economic reform programme in the 1980s, initiated by lifting
                    import
                    quotas and giving more opportunities to the private sector. At the time tourism sector which would
                    play
                    a significant role in the nation's development was at its infant stage. Agriculture and
                    manufacturing continue
                    to play lesser roles in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and
                    the
                    shortage of domestic labour.

                <p><img src="images/tourist-maldives.jpg" style="float: left">The Maldives remained largely
                    unknown to tourists until the early 1970s. Only 189 islands are home to its 447,137
                    inhabitants. The other islands are used entirely for economic purposes, of which tourism
                    and agriculture are the most dominant. Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of
                    the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties
                    and tourism-related taxes. The development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the country's
                    economy. It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other
                    related
                    industries. The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos Island Resort and Kurumba
                    Village
                    (the current name is Kurumba Maldives),[129] which transformed the Maldives economy.
                    According to the Ministry of Tourism, the emergence of tourism in 1972 transformed the economy,
                    moving rapidly from dependence on fisheries to tourism. In just three and a half decades, the
                    industry became the main source of income. Tourism was also the country's biggest foreign currency
                    earner
                    and the single largest contributor to the GDP.

                    Visitors to the Maldives do not need to apply for a visa pre-arrival,
                    regardless of their country of origin, provided they have a valid passport,
                    proof of onward travel, and the money to be self-sufficient while in the country.
                    Most visitors arrive at Velana International Airport, on Hulhulé Island, adjacent to
                    the capital Malé. The airport is served by flights to and from India, Sri Lanka, Doha, Dubai,
                    Singapore, Istanbul, and major airports in South-East Asia, as well as charters from Europe.
                    Gan Airport, on the southern atoll of Addu, also serves an international flight to Milan several
                    times a week. British Airways offers direct flights to the Maldives around 2–3 times per week.

                <p>The largest ethnic group is <span>Dhivehin</span>, i.e. the Maldivians, native to the
                    historic region of the Maldive Islands comprising today's Republic of Maldives
                    and the island of Minicoy in Union territory of Lakshadweep, India. They share the same
                    culture and speak the Dhivehi language. They are principally an Indo-Aryan people, having
                    traces of Middle Eastern, South Asian, Austronesian and African genes in the population.
                    The population doubled by 1978, and the population
                    growth rate peaked at 3.4% in 1985. At the 2006 census, the population had reached 298,968,
                    although the census in 2000 showed that the population growth rate had declined to 1.9%.
                    Life expectancy at birth stood at 46 years in 1978, and later rose to 72. Infant mortality has
                    declined from 12.7% in 1977 to 1.2% today, and adult literacy reached 99%. Combined school
                    enrolment
                    reached the high 90s. The population was projected to have reached 317,280 in 2010.</p>
